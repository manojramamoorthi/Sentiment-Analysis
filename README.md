📝 **Sentiment Analysis Tool**  

This project is an **intelligent sentiment classifier** that analyzes text using **machine learning** and **natural language processing techniques**.  

It leverages:  
#NLP (stemming & stopword removal) for text preprocessing  
#TF-IDF for feature extraction  
#Logistic Regression for sentiment classification  
#Gradio for a **user-friendly interactive interface**  

🚀 **Features:**


✅ Clean and preprocess text using **stemming & stopword removal**  


✅ Convert text into vectorized embeddings with **TF-IDF**  


✅ Predict sentiment (Positive/Negative) using a **trained model**  


✅ Display results with **color-coded Gradio output**  



🎯 **How to Use:**  
Run the script, input any text, and get a **real-time sentiment analysis** powered by machine learning.
